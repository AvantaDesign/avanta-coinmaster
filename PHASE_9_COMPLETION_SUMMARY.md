## 1. Receipt Upload and OCR Processing ✅

### Research and Planning

**Research Document:** `docs/OCR_RESEARCH.md`

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ Selected Tesseract.js for MVP (free, client-side OCR)
- ✅ Documented Google Cloud Vision API for future upgrade
- ✅ Cost analysis showing zero cost for MVP
- ✅ Privacy-friendly approach with client-side processing

**Recommendation:** Start with Tesseract.js, upgrade to Cloud Vision when usage justifies cost ($1.50-5/month for typical usage)

  - Confidence scoring
  - Extracted data storage (JSON)
  - Transaction linking
- ✅ Added `receipt_id` column to transactions table
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance
- ✅ Foreign key relationships

**SQL Highlights:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS receipts (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
