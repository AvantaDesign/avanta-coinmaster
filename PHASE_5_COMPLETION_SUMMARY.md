# Phase 5 Implementation Complete - Project Summary

## Overview
Phase 5 of the Avanta Finance application has been successfully completed, implementing In-App Financial Activities and Workflows. This final phase adds a comprehensive guided experience for users to perform their regular financial tasks efficiently.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 013)
**File:** `migrations/013_add_notifications.sql`

Created four new tables:
- **notifications**: Stores user notifications with types (payment_reminder, tax_deadline, financial_task, system_alert, low_cash_flow, budget_overrun) and priorities (high, medium, low)
- **financial_tasks**: Tracks task completion with frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
- **notification_preferences**: User preferences for notification types and reminder settings
- **user_onboarding**: Tracks onboarding progress for new users

All tables include proper indexes for optimal query performance.

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### Notifications API (`functions/api/notifications.js`)
- GET: Fetch notifications with filtering (by type, unread status, limit)
- POST: Create new notifications
- PUT: Update notifications (mark-read, dismiss, snooze actions)
- DELETE: Remove notifications
- Returns unread count with all list requests

#### Financial Tasks API (`functions/api/financial-tasks.js`)
