## Planning Future Phases (V9+)

When creating new implementation plans (V9, V10, V11, etc.), follow these guidelines:

1. **Continue Sequential Numbering:** Start with Phase 40, then 41, 42, etc.
2. **Reference This Index:** Always check what has been completed
3. **Create New Plan Document:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md` for the next batch
4. **Update This Index:** Add new phases as they are completed
5. **Maintain Archive Structure:** Keep the organized filing system
6. **Document Everything:** Include all file types (prompts, guides, summaries, visuals)

## Next Implementation Plan Guidelines

### For Implementation Plan V9 (Phase 40+)

When starting V9, consider these areas for future development:

**Potential Focus Areas:**
- Advanced analytics and business intelligence
- Enhanced automation features
- Third-party integrations (banks, accounting software)
- Multi-tenant features and organization management
- Advanced reporting and forecasting
- Mobile app development
- API enhancements for external integrations
- Machine learning for expense categorization
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced security features (2FA, audit logs)

**Process:**
1. Create `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md` in root directory
2. Define 8-12 phases (Phases 40-51 for example)
3. Implement and document each phase
4. After completion, move to `docs/archive/implementation-plans/v9/`
5. Move phase files to `docs/archive/phases/phases-40-51/`
6. Update this index with completed phases
