- âœ… **Phase 39: COMPLETE** - Final UI/UX and System Coherence Audit (last phase of V8)
- âœ… **Implementation Plan V8: COMPLETE** - Phases 30-39 (Core Hardening and Functional Expansion)
- âœ… **Implementation Plan V7: COMPLETE** - Phases 17-29 (Total Fiscal Compliance & Automation)
- âœ… **Implementation Plans V4-V6: COMPLETE** - Phases 5-16 (Foundation & Core Features)
- âœ… **Early Phases 0-4: COMPLETE** - Security, authentication, and basic features
- âœ… **Production Ready:** React frontend + Cloudflare Workers backend + D1 database + R2 storage
- âœ… **Deployed:** Live at Cloudflare Pages with full functionality
- âœ… **Documentation Organized:** All phase docs archived in `docs/archive/`
- âœ… **Total Phases Completed:** 35 phases (5-39)

## Next Implementation Plan: V9 (Phase 40+)

**Status:** READY TO START  
**Starting Phase:** Phase 40  
**Documentation:**
- See `PHASES_INDEX.md` for complete history of phases 5-39
- See `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for guidance on creating V9, V10, V11+

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting new work:
1. Review `PHASES_INDEX.md` to understand what has been completed
2. Review `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for best practices and structure
3. Create `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md` with clear objectives and phase definitions
4. Start with Phase 40 (next sequential phase number)

### Phase 6 Tasks:

**DEPRECATED:** The tasks listed below are from an older version of this prompt and are not aligned with the current phase numbering system. Phases 0-39 have been completed through Implementation Plans V4-V8.

**For current work:** Create `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md` and define new phases starting from Phase 40.

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Session Length:** 45-60 minutes per phase maximum
### **Code Output:** Production-ready, tested, documented code
### **Documentation:** Update all relevant docs including phase summaries

## Key Steps for Starting V9

1. **Review Documentation:**
   - Read `PHASES_INDEX.md` - understand what's complete
   - Read `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - follow best practices
   - Review `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` - understand current architecture

2. **Create Implementation Plan:**
   - Create `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md` in root directory
   - Define 8-12 phases (typically phases 40-49 or 40-51)
   - Choose a clear theme and objective
   - List all deliverables and verification criteria

3. **Implement Each Phase:**
   - Work on one phase at a time (e.g., start with Phase 40)
   - Create phase documentation as you work
   - Test thoroughly before marking complete
   - Update implementation plan with progress

4. **Document Everything:**
   - Create `PHASE_40_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Create `PHASE_40_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
   - Create `PHASE_40_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md` (if UI changes)
   - Update `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`
   - Update `USER_GUIDE.md` (if user-facing changes)

5. **Archive After Completion:**
   - Move `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md` to `docs/archive/implementation-plans/v9/`
   - Move all phase files to `docs/archive/phases/phases-40-{end}/`
   - Update `PHASES_INDEX.md` with V9 summary

## File Organization

### During Development (Root Directory)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md` - Active plan
- `PHASE_40_*.md` - Active phase documents
- `PHASE_41_*.md` - Active phase documents
- etc.

### After Completion (Archive)
- `docs/archive/implementation-plans/v9/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md`
- `docs/archive/phases/phases-40-{end}/PHASE_40_*.md`
- `docs/archive/phases/phases-40-{end}/PHASE_41_*.md`
- etc.

## Development Commands
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test with Cloudflare backend (if needed)
npx wrangler pages dev dist --d1 DB=avanta-finance --r2 RECEIPTS=avanta-receipts --port 8788

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (production)
