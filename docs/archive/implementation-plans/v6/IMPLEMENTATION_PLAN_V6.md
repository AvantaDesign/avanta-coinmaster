# Implementation Plan v6 (Completed Phases Only)

This document outlines the **completed phases** from the Avanta Finance application development plan. All unimplemented phases have been consolidated into `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V7.md`.

## âœ… COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 15: UI/UX Refinements âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** To refine the user interface and experience by addressing contrast issues, improving navigation, and ensuring full localization.

**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - All tasks implemented successfully

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  âœ… **Dark Mode Contrast Fixes:**
    *   Audited all components in dark mode and identified elements with low contrast.
    *   Modified TailwindCSS theme colors and component styles to ensure WCAG AA compliance.

2.  âœ… **Notifications Center Relocation:**
    *   Moved the notification trigger from the user dropdown to a dedicated bell icon in the main navbar.
    *   Implemented a badge on the bell icon to display the count of unread notifications.

3.  âœ… **Responsive Navbar:**
    *   Implemented a breakpoint-based mechanism that collapses the main navigation into a hamburger menu on smaller desktop window sizes.

4.  âœ… **Remove Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    *   Identified and removed the code related to the keyboard shortcuts feature, keeping the "Quick Actions" button.

5.  âœ… **Full Spanish Localization:**
    *   Searched the frontend codebase for hardcoded English strings and translated them to contextual Spanish.

### Phase 16: Core Tax Logic - Data Model & Expense Module âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** To establish the foundational data model for granular Mexican tax rules and build the user interface for detailed expense classification.

**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - All tasks implemented successfully

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  âœ… **Database Schema Enhancement (Migration):**
    *   Modified the `transactions` table to replace the generic `is_deductible` with specific boolean flags: `is_isr_deductible` and `is_iva_accreditable`.
    *   Added fields for `deductibility_notes` (text), `expense_type` (e.g., `operativo`, `inversion`, `personal`), `status` (e.g., `pagado`, `pendiente`, `a crÃ©dito`), and `retenciones_efectuadas` (JSON or TEXT).
    *   Created a `proportional_expenses` table to manage items with mixed personal/business use and store their business-use percentage.

2.  âœ… **Backend API Updates (`/api/transactions`):**
    *   Updated POST/PUT endpoints to handle all new granular fields.
    *   Created new endpoints for managing `proportional_expenses`.

3.  âœ… **Frontend Expense Module (`MÃ³dulo de Egresos`):**
    *   Updated the `AddTransaction` / `EditTransaction` forms to include the new classification options, status, and retentions fields.
    *   Implemented UI for managing proportional expenses, allowing users to set a percentage and link it to relevant transactions.
    *   Ensured the UI prevents marking a transaction as `is_isr_deductible` if payment was in cash over $2,000 MXN.
    *   Visually tagged non-deductible expenses in the transaction list for clear identification.
