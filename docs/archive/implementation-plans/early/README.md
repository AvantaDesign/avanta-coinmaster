# Early Implementation Plans Archive

This directory contains the earliest implementation plans and documentation from the initial phases of Avanta Finance development (before versioned implementation plans V4-V8).

## Contents

### Implementation Plans
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md` - Original comprehensive implementation plan (previously IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Early implementation summary
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_CHECKLIST.md` - Authentication system implementation checklist

## Timeline

These documents represent the project's early development phases:
- **Phase 0**: Security and authentication foundations
- **Phases 1-4**: Initial feature development
- Pre-V4 planning and architecture decisions

## Evolution

The implementation planning process evolved from these early documents into the structured versioned plans (V4-V8) found in the other subdirectories. These early documents show:
- Initial project vision and scope
- Original architecture decisions
- Early security implementation
- Foundation for structured phase planning
