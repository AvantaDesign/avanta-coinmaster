This directory contains prompts and instructions used to guide AI agents (like Gemini) in working on the Avanta Finance project across different development sessions.

## Contents

## Purpose

These documents serve to:
- Maintain continuity across development sessions
- Provide context about the project to AI agents
- Standardize how agents should approach tasks
- Document the evolution of agent instructions over time

## Evolution

The prompts have evolved through multiple versions (V1-V4) as the project grew and development patterns were refined. Each version typically includes:
- Project overview and context
- Architecture and technology stack
- Development conventions
- Current status and priorities
- Instructions for specific tasks

## Current Active Prompt

The most current agent instructions are maintained in `GEMINI.md` in the root directory. The versions here are archived for reference and to understand the project's development history.
