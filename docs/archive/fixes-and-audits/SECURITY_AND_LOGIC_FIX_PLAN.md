## 2. Phase 1: Critical Security Hardening

This phase focuses on resolving the most severe security vulnerabilities that pose an immediate threat to user data and system integrity.

### Task 1.1: Implement Secure Password Hashing

**Objective:** Replace the current plaintext password storage and comparison with a strong, industry-standard hashing mechanism using the Web Crypto API, which is available in Cloudflare Workers.

**File to Modify:** `functions/api/auth.js`

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Create a Password Hashing Utility:**
    *   In `functions/api/auth.js`, create two new helper functions: `hashPassword(password)` and `verifyPassword(password, hash)`.
    *   **`hashPassword(password)`:**
        *   This function will take a plaintext password string.
        *   It will use `crypto.subtle.digest` to hash the password with the `SHA-256` algorithm.
        *   To prevent rainbow table attacks, generate a unique salt for each password using `crypto.getRandomValues`.
        *   Return both the hash and the salt, typically concatenated or in an object. A common format is `salt:hash`.
    *   **`verifyPassword(password, storedHash)`:**
        *   This function will take a plaintext password and the stored hash-with-salt string.
        *   It will extract the salt from the stored string, apply the same `SHA-256` hashing process to the incoming password using that salt.
        *   It will then perform a constant-time comparison to check if the newly generated hash matches the stored hash.

2.  **Update User Registration/Creation Logic:**
    *   *Note: A user registration endpoint is not visible in the current files. This step assumes one will be created or that the user creation logic will be updated.*
    *   When a new user is created, call `hashPassword()` on their provided password.
    *   Store the resulting salted hash in the `password` column of the `users` table. **Never store the plaintext password.**

3.  **Update Login Logic:**
    *   In the `handleLogin` function in `functions/api/auth.js`:
    *   First, retrieve the user from the database based on their email.
    *   Instead of the current `user.password === password` comparison, call `await verifyPassword(password, user.password)`.
    *   Proceed with login only if `verifyPassword` returns `true`.

4.  **Database Migration:**
    *   A one-time migration script must be created and run to convert all existing plaintext passwords in the `users` table to salted hashes. This script will read each user's password, hash it using the new `hashPassword` function, and update the database record.

### Task 1.2: Secure JWT Implementation with `jose`

**Objective:** Replace the insecure, custom JWT implementation with the `jose` library, a standard for JWTs in edge environments.

**File to Modify:** `functions/api/auth.js`

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Add `jose` Dependency:**
    *   Ensure `jose` is added as a project dependency. Since this is a backend function, it should be managed appropriately within the Cloudflare Workers environment.

2.  **Refactor JWT Generation (`encodeJWT`):**
    *   Replace the `encodeJWT` function.
    *   The new function will use `new jose.SignJWT(payload)`.
    *   Set the protected header: `.setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })`.
    *   Set the expiration time: `.setExpirationTime('24h')`.
    *   Set the issuer and audience for best practice: `.setIssuer(...)`, `.setAudience(...)`.
    *   Sign the token using a secret key from `env.JWT_SECRET`. The secret must be encoded using a `TextEncoder`.
    *   Example: `await new jose.SignJWT({...})...sign(new TextEncoder().encode(env.JWT_SECRET))`

3.  **Refactor JWT Verification (`decodeJWT`):**
    *   Replace the `decodeJWT` function.
    *   The new function will use `jose.jwtVerify(token, secret)`.
    *   It will automatically handle signature verification, expiration checks, and return the payload if valid.
    *   Wrap the call in a `try...catch` block to handle invalid or expired tokens gracefully.

### Task 1.3: Enforce Global Authentication and Authorization

**Objective:** Ensure all API endpoints that handle sensitive or user-specific data are protected by a robust authentication and authorization check.

**Files to Modify:**
*   `functions/_worker.js`
*   All data-related API endpoints (e.g., `functions/api/fiscal.js`, `functions/api/accounts.js`, etc.)

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Create an Authentication Middleware:**
    *   In `functions/_worker.js`, create a function `authenticate(request, env, handler)`.
    *   This function will:
        *   Call `getUserIdFromToken(request, env)` from `auth.js`.
        *   If no valid `userId` is returned, immediately respond with a `401 Unauthorized` error.
        *   If a `userId` is present, attach it to the `request` object for downstream use (e.g., `request.userId = userId`).
        *   Call the original `handler(request, env, ctx)` to proceed with the request.

2.  **Apply Middleware to Routes:**
    *   In the `switch` statement within `functions/_worker.js`, wrap each protected route's handler in the `authenticate` middleware.
    *   Example: `return authenticate(request, env, (req, env, ctx) => dashboardModule.default(req, env, ctx));`

3.  **Scope Database Queries:**
    *   For every API endpoint that is now authenticated, modify all database queries to include a `WHERE user_id = ?` clause.
    *   The `userId` should be retrieved from the `request` object (e.g., `const userId = request.userId;`).
    *   This is critical for `fiscal.js`, `accounts.js`, `transactions.js`, etc., to prevent users from accessing each other's data.

## 3. Phase 2: Data Integrity and Calculation Accuracy

This phase addresses logical flaws that could lead to incorrect financial calculations and data inconsistencies.

### Task 2.1: Integrate `decimal.js` for Financial Calculations

**Objective:** Eradicate floating-point precision errors by using a dedicated decimal arithmetic library for all financial math.

**Files to Modify:** `functions/api/fiscal.js`, `functions/api/transactions.js`, and any other files performing monetary calculations.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Add `decimal.js` Dependency:**
    *   Add the `decimal.js` library to the project's dependencies.

2.  **Refactor All Financial Operations:**
    *   Import `Decimal` from `decimal.js` in all relevant files.
    *   Wrap every monetary value retrieved from the database or user input in `new Decimal(...)` before performing any arithmetic.
    *   Replace all standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) with `decimal.js` methods (`.plus()`, `.minus()`, `.times()`, `.div()`).
    *   **Example in `fiscal.js`:**
        *   Change `const utilidad = businessIncome - deductible;` to `const utilidad = new Decimal(businessIncome).minus(deductible);`.
        *   Change `const ivaCobrado = businessIncome * 0.16;` to `const ivaCobrado = new Decimal(businessIncome).times(0.16);`.

3.  **Format Output:**
    *   When returning JSON responses, convert Decimal objects back to formatted strings using `.toFixed(2)` to ensure a consistent, two-decimal-place currency format.

### Task 2.2: Implement Database Transactions with `D1.batch()`

**Objective:** Guarantee atomicity for database operations that involve multiple steps, preventing the database from being left in an inconsistent state.

**Files to Modify:** Any endpoint performing multiple related database writes.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Transactional Operations:**
    *   Review the codebase for any process that writes to the database more than once in a single logical operation. For example, creating a transaction and simultaneously updating a category's total spend.

2.  **Implement `D1.batch()`:**
    *   For the identified operations, refactor them to use Cloudflare D1's `batch()` method.
    *   Create an array of prepared statements.
    *   Execute them by calling `await env.DB.batch([stmt1, stmt2, ...])`.
    *   This ensures that all statements in the batch either succeed together or fail together, maintaining data integrity.

## 4. Phase 3: Configuration and Best Practices

This phase involves tightening configurations and adhering to security best practices.

### Task 3.1: Implement a Stricter CORS Policy

**Objective:** Restrict API access to only the legitimate frontend application, mitigating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other cross-origin attacks.

**File to Modify:** `functions/_worker.js`

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Define Allowed Origin:**
    *   Store the frontend application's domain in a Cloudflare environment variable (e.g., `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`).

2.  **Update CORS Headers:**
    *   In the CORS configuration, change `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'` to `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN`.
    *   Add the `Vary: Origin` header to responses to ensure caches handle the dynamic origin correctly.

### Task 3.2: Harden SQL Injection Defenses

**Objective:** Add redundant safeguards and documentation to prevent potential future SQL injection vulnerabilities in dynamic queries.

**File to Modify:** `functions/api/transactions.js`

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Reinforce Whitelist Validation:**
    *   The current whitelist validation for the `sort_by` parameter is good. This step is about making it more robust and self-documenting.
    *   Add a comment directly above the validation block explaining *why* it's critical for security.
    *   Example: `// SECURITY: Whitelist validation for 'sort_by' is crucial to prevent SQL injection.`
    *   Ensure the check is strict and does not allow any characters that could be used to break out of the query.

## 5. Validation and Testing Plan

**Objective:** Rigorously test all changes to verify the fixes and ensure no new bugs have been introduced.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Automated Testing:**
    *   Write new unit tests for the `password.js` utility to verify hashing and verification logic.
    *   Write integration tests for the login endpoint (`/api/auth/login`) to confirm it works with hashed passwords.
    *   Write tests for the `fiscal.js` endpoint using `decimal.js` to assert calculation accuracy with known edge cases.

2.  **Manual Testing Checklist:**
    *   **Authentication:**
        *   Attempt to log in with a user whose password has been migrated.
        *   Create a new user and log in.
        *   Attempt to access protected endpoints (e.g., `/api/transactions`) without a token (expect 401).
        *   Attempt to access endpoints with an invalid or expired token (expect 401).
    *   **Data Integrity:**
        *   Verify that financial reports in `fiscal.js` are accurate to two decimal places.
        *   If transactional operations were implemented, test the failure case (e.g., by trying to insert invalid data in the second step) and confirm that the entire transaction is rolled back.
    *   **CORS:**
        *   Use browser developer tools to attempt a `fetch` request to the API from a different origin (e.g., the console of `example.com`) and confirm it is blocked by the CORS policy.
