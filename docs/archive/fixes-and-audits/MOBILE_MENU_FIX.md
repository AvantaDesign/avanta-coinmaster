# Mobile Menu Navigation Fix

## Problem
The mobile navbar dropdown menu items were not navigating to subpages when clicked. Users would click a menu item, the dropdown would close, but no navigation would occur.

## Root Cause
In `src/App.jsx`, the mobile dropdown menu items (lines 321-335) had an `onClick` handler that was calling `e.preventDefault()` before attempting to navigate:

```javascript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();        // This was blocking the Link navigation!
  navigate(item.path);
  setActiveDropdown(null);
  setMobileMenuOpen(false);
}}
```

The `e.preventDefault()` call was preventing the React Router `<Link>` component from handling the navigation naturally. While the code then attempted to manually call `navigate()`, this approach was problematic because:

1. The event's default behavior (navigation) was blocked
2. The menu state changes happened immediately, potentially interrupting the navigation
3. React Router's `<Link>` component is designed to handle navigation without explicit `preventDefault()` calls

## Solution
Removed the `e.preventDefault()` and the manual `navigate()` call, allowing the `<Link>` component to handle navigation naturally:

```javascript
onClick={() => {
  setActiveDropdown(null);
  setMobileMenuOpen(false);
}}
```

Now when a mobile menu item is clicked:
1. The `<Link>` component handles navigation to the correct route
2. The dropdown and mobile menu close properly
3. Navigation works correctly on all mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)

## Changes Made
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`
- **Lines**: 326-328
- **Change**: Removed `e.preventDefault()` and manual `navigate()` call from mobile dropdown menu items

## Testing
The fix has been built successfully and is ready for testing on mobile devices. To test:

1. Open the application on a mobile device or use Chrome DevTools mobile emulator
2. Open the mobile menu (hamburger icon)
3. Tap on any dropdown menu (e.g., "Finanzas", "Fiscal", "Operaciones")
4. Tap on any submenu item (e.g., "Transacciones", "Facturas", etc.)
5. Verify that:
   - The menu closes
   - Navigation occurs to the selected page
   - The correct content is displayed

## Why This Works
React Router's `<Link>` component is built to handle navigation without requiring explicit `preventDefault()` calls. By removing the event manipulation and letting the Link work naturally:

- Navigation is handled by React Router's internal mechanisms
- The routing history is properly maintained
- Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
- The navigation is more reliable across different browsers and devices

## Note
The single-type menu items (like "Dashboard") were already working correctly because they didn't have the `e.preventDefault()` issue. Only the dropdown menu items were affected.
