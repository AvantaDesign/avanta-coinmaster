## Verification Steps

1. Run `npm run build` to ensure the application compiles without errors
2. Test task creation, editing, and completion
3. Verify task recurrence works correctly
4. Test notification generation and display
5. Verify notifications link to correct pages
6. Test onboarding flow for new users
7. Ensure help center content is accessible
8. Test keyboard shortcuts
9. Verify all new features integrate properly with existing components
10. Test notification preferences
11. Verify task filtering and search functionality

## Progress Tracking

**MANDATORY:** Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V4.md` with checkmarks (âœ…) as you complete each task.

- Mark subtasks as completed with descriptive commit messages
- Update the Phase 5 section with detailed completion notes
- Mark Phase 5 as completed when all tasks are done

## Technical Considerations

1. **Follow Existing Patterns:**
   - Use the same component structure as other dashboards
   - Follow the API pattern from existing endpoints
   - Use the same styling and UI components

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure all new components work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Use Tailwind CSS utilities consistently
   - Test dark mode support

3. **Performance:**
   - Lazy load the onboarding component
   - Optimize notification polling (use intervals or WebSocket if available)
   - Paginate task lists for large datasets

4. **Data Validation:**
   - Validate task recurrence rules
   - Ensure notification scheduling works correctly
   - Validate due dates and reminder configurations

5. **User Experience:**
   - Provide clear feedback on actions
   - Use loading states appropriately
   - Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

6. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
   - Use proper ARIA labels
   - Provide text alternatives for icons

## Database Seeding

Create a seed script or migration to populate default tasks for new users:
- Location: `migrations/014_seed_default_tasks.sql` or similar
- Include tasks for all frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Set appropriate priorities and categories

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create and complete recurring tasks
- [ ] Verify task recurrence generates new occurrences
- [ ] Test notification creation for various triggers
- [ ] Test marking notifications as read/dismissed
- [ ] Complete onboarding flow as a new user
- [ ] Navigate help center and search for topics
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Use quick actions panel

- [ ] Test task templates
- [ ] Verify integration with dashboard

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion and verification of all Phase 5 tasks:

1. Generate a comprehensive summary of Phase 5 implementation
2. Document any remaining technical debt or future enhancements
3. Create a maintenance and support guide
4. Prepare user documentation
5. Consider Phase 6 enhancements (if needed):
   - Multi-user support and permissions
   - Advanced reporting and analytics
   - Integration with external services (banks, accounting software)

## Success Criteria

Phase 5 will be considered complete when:

1. âœ… All database migrations are created and documented
2. âœ… All API endpoints are implemented and tested
3. âœ… All frontend components are created and functional
4. âœ… Navigation and routing are updated
