## Current Task: Phase 29 - System-Wide Connectivity & Rules Verification

### Goal

To perform a final, holistic audit of the entire system, ensuring that all data points, metadata, and automated rules are interconnected correctly and produce accurate fiscal calculations under all circumstances. This is the **FINAL PHASE** before production deployment.

### Context from Previous Phase

Phase 28 successfully implemented:
- âœ… Intelligent compliance rules engine with 10 SAT rules
- âœ… Real-time transaction validation and feedback
- âœ… Compliance dashboard with suggestions, rules, and execution log
- âœ… Automated fiscal metadata enrichment
- âœ… Rule execution audit trail
- âœ… Complete integration with transaction forms

The system now has comprehensive compliance automation and needs thorough end-to-end verification.
