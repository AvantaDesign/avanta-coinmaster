## 🎯 Objectives Achieved

### 1. Database Schema - Declaration Management ✅

Created a comprehensive database structure to manage all aspects of SAT declarations:

#### Tables Created:
- **`sat_declarations`**: Main declaration tracking table
  - Supports multiple declaration types (DIOT, Contabilidad Electrónica, etc.)
  - Tracks status lifecycle (draft → generated → submitted → accepted/rejected)
  - Stores XML content and file metadata
  - Records SAT responses and submission dates

- **`diot_operations`**: Detailed operations with third parties
  - Tracks client RFC and nationality
  - Records operation types (purchase, sale, service, rent)
  - Manages amounts, IVA, and currency conversions
  - Links to CFDI UUIDs and payment methods

- **`contabilidad_electronica_files`**: Individual XML file tracking
  - Manages four file types: Catálogo de Cuentas, Balanza de Comprobación, Pólizas, Auxiliar de Folios
  - Tracks validation status and record counts
  - Stores validation errors for troubleshooting

#### Supporting Infrastructure:
- **Indexes**: 15+ indexes for efficient querying by user, period, type, status, and RFC
- **Views**: 4 pre-built views for summaries and analytics
- **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp updates and smart status management

### 2. Backend API Development ✅

Implemented a robust backend API system for declaration generation and management:

#### Core Endpoints:
```
GET    /api/sat-declarations          - List declarations with filtering
GET    /api/sat-declarations/:id      - Get single declaration with details
POST   /api/sat-declarations/diot/:year/:month - Generate DIOT
POST   /api/sat-declarations/contabilidad/:year/:month - Generate Contabilidad Electrónica
POST   /api/sat-declarations/submit/:id - Submit to SAT
PUT    /api/sat-declarations/:id      - Update declaration status
DELETE /api/sat-declarations/:id      - Delete declaration
```

#### DIOT Generation Engine:
- Extracts operations with third parties from transaction database
- Validates RFC format (minimum 12 characters)
- Groups operations by client RFC and operation type
- Calculates base amounts and IVA by rate (0%, 8%, 16%, exempt)
- Handles currency conversions with exchange rates
- Generates SAT-compliant DIOT XML format
- Provides operation count and summary statistics

#### Contabilidad Electrónica Engine:
Generates all four required XML files for Anexo 24:

1. **Catálogo de Cuentas XML**
   - Uses `sat_accounts_catalog` table
   - Includes hierarchical account structure
   - Properly formatted with código agrupador

2. **Balanza de Comprobación XML**
   - Calculates account balances from transactions
   - Shows initial balances, debits, credits, and final balances
   - Grouped by account and SAT code

3. **Pólizas XML**
   - Generates accounting entries from transactions
   - Includes transaction details with debits/credits
   - Properly dated and sequenced

4. **Auxiliar de Folios XML**
   - Extracts CFDI metadata from the period
   - Includes emitter/receiver information
   - Links to CFDI UUIDs

#### XML Generation Features:
- Proper XML escaping for special characters
- SAT schema-compliant formatting
- Correct encoding (UTF-8)
- Namespace declarations
- Version control (1.3)

### 3. Frontend UI - SAT Declarations ✅
