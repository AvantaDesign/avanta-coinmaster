## Current Task: Phase 22 - Annual Declaration & Advanced Analytics

### Goal

Implement the annual tax calculation engine and build high-level fiscal dashboards for comprehensive tax planning and compliance.

### Context from Previous Phases

Phase 21 successfully implemented:
- âœ… DIOT (DeclaraciÃ³n Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros) generation
- âœ… Contabilidad ElectrÃ³nica XML generation (4 file types)
- âœ… Declaration lifecycle tracking (draft â†’ generated â†’ submitted â†’ accepted)
- âœ… XML file generation and download functionality
- âœ… Comprehensive declaration management interface
- âœ… Integration with transaction data, CFDI metadata, and SAT accounts catalog

The system now has complete monthly tax calculations (ISR/IVA) and official declaration generation. Phase 22 builds upon this foundation to implement annual tax declarations and advanced fiscal analytics.

   - Apply category-specific limits:
     - Medical expenses: 10% of annual income
     - Education: UMA-based limits per level
     - Mortgage interest: specific caps
     - Retirement contributions: 10% of income or 5 UMA annual
     - Donations: 7% of taxable income
   - Calculate total allowed personal deductions (max 15% of income or 5 UMA annual)

4. **ISR Calculation:**
   - Apply annual ISR tariff table (Art. 152)
   - Subtract monthly provisional payments
   - Subtract withholdings
   - Calculate final balance (refund or payment)

5. **Generate Declaration:**
   - Create annual_declarations record

### 4. Personal Deduction Management

**Implement deduction limit logic:**

```javascript
// Medical Expenses Limit
const medicalLimit = annualIncome * 0.10;

// Education Limit (by level, UMA-based)
const educationLimits = {
  'preschool': UMA_ANNUAL * 0.90,
  'primary_secondary': UMA_ANNUAL * 1.40,
  'high_school': UMA_ANNUAL * 1.70,
  'university': UMA_ANNUAL * 2.80
};

// Mortgage Interest Limit
const mortgageLimit = UMA_ANNUAL * 5;

// Retirement Contributions Limit
const retirementLimit = Math.min(
  annualIncome * 0.10,
  UMA_ANNUAL * 5
);

// Donations Limit
const donationsLimit = taxableIncome * 0.07;

// Total Personal Deductions Limit
const totalPersonalLimit = Math.min(
  annualIncome * 0.15,
  UMA_ANNUAL * 5
);
```

**Validation Flow:**
1. User adds personal deduction
2. System checks category-specific limit
3. Calculate total personal deductions
4. Validate against overall limit
5. Show warnings if limits exceeded
6. Apply allowed amount in annual calculation

### 6. Integration Points

**Connect with existing phases:**
- Phase 17: Use income module data and fiscal parameters
- Phase 18: Link CFDI data to personal deductions
- Phase 19: Use monthly ISR/IVA calculations for annual summary
- Phase 20: Integrate bank reconciliation status in compliance score
- Phase 21: Use DIOT and Contabilidad data for annual declaration

**Data Consistency:**
- Annual totals must match sum of monthly calculations
- Personal deductions must have CFDI support (where required)
- All amounts must trace back to transactions
- Deduction limits must use current UMA values

---

## Progress Tracking

**MANDATORY:**
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V7.md` with checkmarks (âœ…) as you complete each task
- Create completion summary document `PHASE_22_ANNUAL_DECLARATION_SUMMARY.md` when finished
- Commit your changes with descriptive messages
- Mark Phase 22 as completed when all tasks are done

---

## Technical Considerations

### Annual ISR Calculation Complexity
- Must accumulate all income and deductions for the year
- Apply progressive tariff table (different from monthly)
- Handle multiple deduction categories with varying limits
- Calculate interaction between business and personal deductions
- Subtract all provisional payments made during the year

### Personal Deduction Limits
- Each category has its own limit calculation
- Overall limit on total personal deductions
- Must validate CFDI requirement for certain deductions
- UMA values change annually (must use correct year)
- Some limits are absolute, others are percentage-based

### Dashboard Performance
- Optimize queries for year-to-date calculations
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use database views for complex aggregations
- Implement efficient chart data preparation
- Consider lazy loading for widgets

### Report Generation
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Optimize export file generation
- Implement streaming for large exports
- Provide progress indicators
- Handle memory constraints

---

## Database Considerations

### Data Integrity
- Annual totals must match monthly sums
- Deduction limits must be validated on insert/update
- Foreign key relationships must cascade properly
- Calculation metadata should be stored for audit

### Performance
- Index all year-based queries
- Create materialized views for dashboard queries
- Optimize deduction limit calculations
- Use efficient aggregation queries

### Data Archiving
- Plan for multi-year data retention
- Consider archiving old declarations
- Maintain calculation history
- Preserve audit trail

---

## Mexican Tax Law Compliance

### ISR (Art. 152 LISR)
- Implement correct annual tariff table
- Apply all required deductions
- Calculate correctly the tax base
- Handle edge cases (negative income, etc.)

### Personal Deductions (Art. 151 LISR)
- Implement all 10 deduction categories
- Apply correct limits for each category
- Validate CFDI requirements
- Calculate overall deduction limit

### UMA Values
- Use correct UMA for the fiscal year
- Update annually (currently: daily $113.14, monthly $3,439.46, annual $41,273.52)
- Apply to all UMA-based calculations

### Declaration Deadlines
- Annual declaration: April 30 of following year
- Automatic reminders and alerts
- Track submission status

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation
- Validate all deduction amounts
- Verify CFDI existence when required
- Validate year ranges
- Sanitize all user inputs

### Access Control
- User can only access their own declarations
- Admin can view all declarations
- Proper authentication on all endpoints

### Audit Logging
- Log all calculation changes
- Track declaration status changes
- Record deduction additions/modifications
- Maintain complete audit trail

---

## Next Step

Upon successful completion and verification of all Phase 22 tasks, generate and output the complete, self-contained prompt for **Phase 23: Digital Archive & Compliance**, following this same instructional format and referencing the updated implementation plan.
