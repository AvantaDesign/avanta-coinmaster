# Phase 1: Advanced Transaction Classification - Testing Guide

## Test Date: October 14, 2025
## Version: Phase 1 - Complete Implementation

---

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for Phase 1: Advanced Transaction Classification features. These features extend the transaction model with advanced classification options, soft delete functionality, and improved data organization.

---

## Features to Test

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- New `transaction_type` field (business/personal/transfer)
- New `category_id` field (link to categories)
- New `linked_invoice_id` field (link to invoices/CFDIs)
- New `notes` field (up to 1000 characters)
- New `is_deleted` field (soft delete flag)

### 2. Backend API Enhancements
- POST endpoint accepts new fields
- PATCH endpoint for partial updates
- DELETE endpoint performs soft delete
- POST /:id/restore endpoint for restoration
- GET endpoint filters soft-deleted by default

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Transaction type selector in creation form
- Category and invoice dropdowns
- Notes textarea with character counter
- Visual indicators in transaction table
- Soft delete/restore functionality

---

## Test Procedures

### A. Database Migration Tests

#### A1. Apply Migration
```bash
# Option 1: Using wrangler CLI (for production D1)
wrangler d1 execute avanta-finance --file=migrations/002_add_advanced_transaction_classification.sql

# Option 2: Using local D1 database
npx wrangler d1 execute avanta-finance --local --file=migrations/002_add_advanced_transaction_classification.sql
```

**Expected Result:**
- All 5 new columns added successfully
- Indexes created without errors
- Existing transactions updated with default values

#### A2. Verify Schema
```bash
wrangler d1 execute avanta-finance --command="PRAGMA table_info(transactions);"
```

**Expected Columns:**

  -d '{
    "date": "2025-10-14",
    "description": "Test",

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2025-10-14",
    "description": "Test",
    "amount": 100,
    "type": "ingreso",
    "category": "personal",

- Error: "notes must be 1000 characters or less"

---

### E. Backward Compatibility Tests

#### E1. Existing Transactions

**Test Case: Query Old Transactions**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8788/api/transactions"
```

**Expected Result:**
- All existing transactions returned
- New fields have default values:
  - transaction_type = "personal"
  - category_id = null
  - linked_invoice_id = null
  - notes = null or ""
  - is_deleted = 0
- No errors or missing data

#### E2. Old API Calls Still Work

**Test Case: Create Transaction Without New Fields**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8788/api/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2025-10-14",
    "description": "Old style transaction",
    "amount": 500,
    "type": "gasto",
    "category": "personal"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
- Status: 201 Created
- Transaction created successfully
- New fields auto-populated with defaults

---

## Performance Tests

### F1. Query Performance with New Indexes

**Test Case: Query by Transaction Type**
```bash
# Time the query
time curl "http://localhost:8788/api/transactions?transaction_type=business&limit=1000"
```

**Expected Result:**
- Query completes in < 100ms
- Index on transaction_type used efficiently

### F2. Soft Delete Impact

**Test Case: Query Performance with Many Deleted Transactions**
1. Create 1000 transactions
2. Soft delete 500 of them
3. Query all active transactions

**Expected Result:**
- Query performance not significantly degraded
- Index on is_deleted used for filtering

---

## Integration Tests

### G1. End-to-End Workflow

**Scenario: Complete Transaction Lifecycle**
1. Create new business transaction with all fields
2. Link it to an invoice
3. Add notes
4. View in transaction table
5. Edit transaction type
6. Soft delete transaction
7. Restore transaction
8. Hard delete transaction

**Expected Result:**
- All steps complete successfully
- Data integrity maintained throughout
- No errors or data loss

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. Foreign key constraints not enforced at database level (D1 limitation)
2. Validation of category_id and linked_invoice_id happens at application level
3. Restore button not yet visible in UI (needs filter to show deleted transactions)

### Future Enhancements
- Add UI filter to view deleted transactions
- Add restore button in transaction table
- Add bulk operations for new fields
- Add audit log for transaction changes
