# Phases Archive

This directory contains all completed phase documentation for the Avanta Finance project.

## Directory Structure

Phases are organized by ranges corresponding to implementation plan versions:

- **phases-05-16/** - Phases 5-16 (Implementation Plans V4-V5)
  - Foundation features, core functionality, advanced features, tax logic

- **phases-17-29/** - Phases 17-29 (Implementation Plan V7)  
  - Total fiscal compliance, CFDI management, tax calculations, declarations

- **phases-30-39/** - Phases 30-39 (Implementation Plan V8)
  - Infrastructure hardening, security audit, performance optimization, UI/UX polish

## Phase Documentation Types

Each phase typically includes multiple files:

- **`PHASE_X_PROMPT.md`** - Initial requirements and specifications
- **`PHASE_X_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Technical implementation details
- **`PHASE_X_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`** - Summary of completed work
- **`PHASE_X_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md`** - Screenshots and UI documentation
- **`PHASE_X_[SPECIFIC].md`** - Other phase-specific documents

## Usage

These are **archived** documents for historical reference:

- ✅ **Complete** - All these phases are finished
- 📚 **Read-only** - No modifications should be made
- 📖 **Reference** - Use to understand implementation details
- 🔍 **Historical** - Shows project development history
- 🎓 **Learning** - See examples of how phases were documented

## For New Development

- **Do NOT modify** these archived phases
- **Create new phases** starting with Phase 40
- **Follow the patterns** established in these archives
- **See** `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for documentation templates
- **See** `PHASES_INDEX.md` for complete phase listing

## Phase Numbering

Phases are numbered sequentially and never reused:

- ✅ Phases 5-39 are complete (archived here)
- 🔄 Phase 40+ are for future development
- ❌ Never create duplicate phase numbers

## Finding Specific Information

To find information about a completed phase:

1. Check `PHASES_INDEX.md` in the root to find which range it's in
2. Navigate to the appropriate `phases-{start}-{end}/` directory
3. Look for files matching `PHASE_{number}_*.md`

Example: To find Phase 25 documentation
- Check `PHASES_INDEX.md` → Phase 25 is in range 17-29
- Go to `phases-17-29/`
- Find `PHASE_25_*.md` files
