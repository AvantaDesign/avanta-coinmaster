echo "Common Issues and Solutions"
echo "================================================"
echo ""

echo "Issue: User is logged out immediately after login"
echo "Solution: This was the bug we fixed. Should not happen anymore."
echo "If it still occurs:"
echo "  1. Check console for errors"
echo "  2. Verify token is stored in localStorage"
echo "  3. Check Network tab for failed requests"
echo ""

echo "Issue: React error #300 (hooks violation)"
echo "Solution: This should be fixed now."
echo "If it still occurs:"
echo "  1. Check if any hooks are called conditionally"
echo "  2. Verify hooks are called in the same order"
echo ""

echo "Issue: Token not stored in localStorage"
echo "Solution:"
echo "  1. Check if browser has localStorage disabled"
echo "  2. Check if in private/incognito mode"
echo "  3. Check browser console for storage errors"
echo ""

echo "================================================"
echo "Debugging Tips"
echo "================================================"
echo ""
echo "1. Console Logs:"
echo "   - Look for logs prefixed with 'auth.js:' or 'AuthProvider:'"
echo "   - These show the authentication flow step by step"
echo ""
echo "2. React DevTools:"
echo "   - Install React DevTools extension"
echo "   - Check AuthProvider state"
echo "   - Verify user state is set after login"
echo ""
echo "3. Network Monitoring:"
echo "   - Watch for API calls to /api/auth/*"
echo "   - Check response payloads"
echo "   - Look for CORS errors"
echo ""
echo "4. State Inspection:"
echo "   - In console, type: localStorage.getItem('avanta_auth_token')"
echo "   - Should return the JWT token"
