Redesign these views with a mobile-first approach, rather than simply stacking desktop elements. Focus on creating a thumb-friendly and optimized layout for small screens.

4.  **Optimize for Touch:**
    *   **Description:** Increase the size of tap targets for all interactive elements on mobile. Implement swipe gestures in data tables (e.g., swipe a transaction to reveal "Edit" and "Delete" actions).

2.  **Dashboard Widget for "IVA Favor/Contra":**
    *   **Description:** Add a prominent widget to the main dashboard that clearly shows the current balance of `IVA Acreditable` vs. `IVA Trasladado`, resulting in a real-time "IVA a favor" or "IVA a pagar" calculation for the current period.

3.  **Visual Cues for `Uso de CFDI`:**
    *   **Description:** In transaction and invoice forms, automatically suggest the appropriate `Uso de CFDI` code based on the selected category, simplifying this mandatory step for Mexican invoicing.

4.  **Full Accessibility (a11y) Audit & Remediation:**
    *   **Description:** Conduct a full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit. Remediate all identified issues, including adding `alt` tags, ensuring proper label associations for forms, enabling full keyboard navigation, and correctly using ARIA attributes.
