## Phase 7: Advanced Financial Planning & Metadata ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Introduce savings goals and enhance data with metadata for better organization and insights.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  ✅ **Savings Goals:**
    *   ✅ **Database:** Created migration `015_add_savings_goals.sql` with `savings_goals` table and linked transactions
    *   ✅ **Backend:** Created API endpoint `/api/savings-goals` with full CRUD functionality, contributions, and progress tracking
    *   ✅ **Frontend:**
        *   Created `SavingsGoals.jsx` component with full management interface
        *   Created `SavingsGoalSummary.jsx` dashboard widget

        *   Integrated with global filter system for personal/business separation
        *   Added navigation route and menu item under "Tesorería"

    *   ✅ **Database:** Created migration `016_add_metadata_fields.sql` adding `metadata` JSON column to `accounts`, `credits`, `debts`, and `investments`
    *   ✅ **Backend:** Updated all entity APIs (`accounts.js`, `credits.js`, `debts.js`, `investments.js`) to support metadata in POST/PUT operations
    *   ✅ **Frontend:**
        *   Created reusable `MetadataEditor.jsx` component with presets for different entity types
        *   Created `relationshipDetector.js` utility for finding related items and calculating insights
        *   Created `MetadataInsights.jsx` component for displaying institution breakdowns, diversification analysis, and suggestions
        *   Metadata editor includes autocomplete suggestions and common field presets

## Phase 8: Tax Modernization and Reconciliation

**Goal:** Update the fiscal module to handle historical data, dynamic tax rates, and provide tools for SAT reconciliation.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Historical Data Import:**
    *   **Frontend:** Create a new UI for importing bank statements (e.g., CSV files). Start with a simple one-month import.
    *   **Backend:** Create an API endpoint to parse the imported files and create transactions.

2.  **SAT Reconciliation Tool:**
    *   **Research:** Analyze the SAT regulations for "persona física con actividad empresarial" as of October 2025.
    *   **Frontend:** Create a new `SATReconciliation.jsx` component. This tool will allow users to compare their financial data in the app with their previous tax declarations.
    *   **Backend:** Develop the logic to identify discrepancies and provide suggestions for corrections.

3.  **Dynamic Fiscal Variables:**
    *   **Backend:** Refactor the `fiscal.js` API to fetch tax rates and other fiscal parameters from a new database table (`fiscal_parameters`) instead of having them hardcoded.
    *   **Frontend:** Create a new settings page where users can view and, if necessary, update these fiscal parameters. Analyze which parameters change monthly vs. annually and design the UI accordingly.

## Phase 9: Advanced Features & Mobile Polish

**Goal:** Introduce receipt processing and ensure a flawless mobile experience.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Receipt Upload and OCR:**
    *   **Research:** Investigate free and open-source OCR solutions that can be integrated with Cloudflare Workers.
    *   **Backend:** Create an API endpoint for uploading receipt images to R2. If a free OCR solution is found, integrate it to extract transaction data.
    *   **Frontend:** Add a feature to upload receipts and, if OCR is implemented, review and confirm the extracted transaction data before saving.
    *   **User Approval:** If no suitable free OCR solution is found, present the options and costs to the user for approval before proceeding with a paid solution.

2.  **Mobile Responsiveness Overhaul:**
    *   **Review:** Conduct a full audit of the application on various mobile screen sizes.
    *   **Fix:** Address all responsiveness issues, including layout problems, unclickable elements, and slow loading times.
    *   **Test:** Thoroughly test the application on real mobile devices or emulators to ensure a high-quality user experience.

## Phase 10: Advanced UX & Security

**Goal:** Enhance the user experience with advanced data management features and improve security with audit logging.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Audit Logging:**
    *   **Database:** Create a new `audit_log` table to store information about important user actions (e.g., user ID, action type, timestamp, details). Create a new migration file.
    *   **Backend:** Create a new API endpoint `/api/audit-log` to record and retrieve audit log entries. Integrate logging into key API endpoints for actions like creating/deleting transactions, updating fiscal settings, etc.
    *   **Frontend:** Create a new `AuditLogViewer.jsx` component to display the audit log in a readable format, with options to filter by user or action type.

2.  **Bulk Transaction Editing:**
    *   **Frontend:** In the main transactions view, add checkboxes to each transaction row to allow for multi-selection.
    *   **Frontend:** Add a "Bulk Edit" button that appears when one or more transactions are selected.
    *   **Frontend:** Create a modal or form that allows the user to change the `type` (personal/business), `category`, or other fields for all selected transactions at once.
    *   **Backend:** Create a new API endpoint `/api/transactions/bulk-update` that can efficiently update multiple transactions in a single request.

3.  **Advanced Search and Filtering:**
    *   **Frontend:** Replace the basic search input with an advanced filtering component. This component should allow users to build complex queries by combining multiple conditions.
    *   **Frontend:** Users should be able to filter by:
        *   `type` (personal/business)
        *   `category`
        *   `amount` (e.g., greater than, less than, equal to)
        *   `date range`
        *   `metadata tags` (from Phase 7)
    *   **Backend:** Update the `GET /api/transactions` endpoint to accept and process these advanced filtering parameters.
