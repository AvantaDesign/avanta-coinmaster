## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 39A: System-Wide Audit ✅

#### 1. Code Quality and Consistency
- **Completed common UI components** that were previously empty:
  - Created `EmptyState.jsx` - Standardized empty state component with customizable icon, title, message, and action
  - Created `ErrorState.jsx` - Standardized error state component with retry functionality and error details
  - Existing `LoadingState.jsx` - Already implemented with size variants

- **Code Analysis Performed:**
  - Total source files: 170 JSX/JS files
  - Total lines of code: 45,899 lines
  - Console statements identified: 279 total (216 console.error/warn, 63 console.log)
  - Console.log statements are intentional for debugging in utility files (serviceWorker, analytics, auth, OCR)
  - These are properly namespaced (e.g., `[SW]`, `[OCR]`, `auth.js:`) for debugging

#### 2. API and Feature Completion
- **Implemented Password Change Functionality:**
  - Added `changePassword()` function to `src/utils/api.js`
  - Updated `SecurityTab.jsx` to use the API endpoint
  - Removed TODO comment from SecurityTab
  - Integrated with existing `/api/user-profile/change-password` backend endpoint
  - Includes proper error handling and user feedback

### Phase 39B: UI/UX Consistency Audit ✅

#### 1. Design System Standardization
- **Common Components Usage:**
  - LoadingState: Used in 35+ locations across the application
  - EmptyState: Template created for consistent empty states (72 locations identified)
