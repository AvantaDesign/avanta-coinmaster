This plan prioritizes:
1.  **Accuracy:** Flawless financial calculations and accounting rules.
2.  **Automation:** Internal automation of tax calculations, compliance, and reporting.
3.  **Security:** Robust security for all financial data.
4.  **User Control:** A clear, powerful UI for managing fiscal data.

## Phase 29: System-Wide Connectivity & Rules Verification

**Goal:** To perform a final, holistic audit of the entire system, ensuring that all data points, metadata, and automated rules are interconnected correctly and produce accurate fiscal calculations under all circumstances.

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **End-to-End Scenario Testing:** Create and execute a comprehensive suite of complex test cases representing real-world fiscal scenarios (e.g., "Proportional deduction expense for a hybrid vehicle, paid with a foreign credit card, without a CFDI").
    2.  **Data Traceability Audit:** For each test case, manually trace the data flow: from the initial guided input -> through the compliance engine -> to the database record -> into the monthly tax calculation -> into the DIOT report -> and finally into the annual declaration.
    3.  **Discrepancy Resolution:** Meticulously identify, document, and fix any discrepancies where the automated rules or calculations do not perfectly match the requirements of `REQUISITOS SAT.md`.
    4.  **Final UAT Simulation:** Simulate a full fiscal year of activity, using the system as the single source of truth, and verify that all generated totals, reports, and declarations are 100% accurate.

*   **Verification:**
    *   The system passes all end-to-end scenario tests with no data corruption or calculation errors.
    *   A full fiscal year simulation produces results that are verifiably correct, establishing ultimate confidence in the system's integrity.
