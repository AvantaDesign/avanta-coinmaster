2. **API Endpoint Review:**
   - Review all 22 API endpoints for consistency
   - Check error handling patterns
   - Verify all endpoints use decimal.js for calculations
   - Ensure all endpoints have proper user isolation (user_id filters)
   - Validate input sanitization and validation

3. **Database Query Optimization:**
   - Review queries for N+1 problems
   - Check if all necessary indexes exist (currently have indexes but verify coverage)
   - Look for opportunities to use batch operations
   - Verify transaction atomicity where needed

4. **State Management Audit:**
   - Review the 3 existing Zustand stores
   - Check if any components still use prop drilling unnecessarily
