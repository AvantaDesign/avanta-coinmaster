## Usage Examples

### Creating a Credit Card

```javascript
const creditCard = {
  name: "BBVA Platino",
  type: "credit_card",
  credit_limit: 50000,
  interest_rate: 0.24,
  statement_day: 20,
  payment_due_day: 5
};

// POST /api/credits
```

### Adding a Payment Movement

```javascript
const payment = {
  description: "Pago mensual",
  amount: 2500,
  type: "payment",
  date: "2025-10-15",
  createTransaction: true  // Creates corresponding transaction
};

// POST /api/credits/:id/movements
```

### Calculating Next Payment Date

```javascript
import { getNextPaymentDueDate, getDaysUntilPayment } from './utils/credits';

const credit = {
  payment_due_day: 15
};

const nextDate = getNextPaymentDueDate(credit.payment_due_day);
const daysUntil = getDaysUntilPayment(credit.payment_due_day);

console.log(`Next payment: ${nextDate}`);
console.log(`Days until payment: ${daysUntil}`);
```

## Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Production
wrangler d1 execute avanta-finance --file=migrations/006_add_credits_module.sql

# Local/Development
wrangler d1 execute avanta-finance --local --file=migrations/006_add_credits_module.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Schema

```bash
# Check tables exist
wrangler d1 execute avanta-finance --command="SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name IN ('credits', 'credit_movements');"

# Check indexes
wrangler d1 execute avanta-finance --command="SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index' AND name LIKE 'idx_credit%';"
```

### Step 3: Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
