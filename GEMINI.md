# Project Overview

This project is a personal and business accounting system called Avanta Finance. It is designed for individuals with business activities in Mexico. The application helps manage financial transactions, calculate monthly taxes (ISR/IVA), handle CFDI invoices, and provides financial dashboards and reports.

## Main Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React 18, TailwindCSS, Vite
*   **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers Functions
*   **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
*   **Storage:** Cloudflare R2
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions to Cloudflare Pages
*   **Automation:** n8n

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is a single-page application built with React and Vite. The backend is a set of serverless functions running on Cloudflare Workers, which interact with a Cloudflare D1 database for data storage and Cloudflare R2 for file storage.
