## Current Task: Phase 23 - Digital Archive & Compliance

### Goal

Implement a secure digital document archive using Cloudflare R2 and create a proactive compliance alert system to help users maintain fiscal compliance and organize supporting documentation.

### Context from Previous Phases

Phase 22 successfully implemented:
- ‚úÖ Annual ISR and IVA declaration generation
- ‚úÖ Personal deductions management
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive fiscal analytics dashboard
- ‚úÖ Real-time compliance monitoring with scoring
- ‚úÖ Tax optimization suggestions
- ‚úÖ Complete integration with Phases 19-21

The system now needs:
1. **Document Storage**: Secure archive for CFDIs, contracts, receipts, and supporting documents
2. **Compliance Alerts**: Proactive notification system for fiscal calendar and validation rules
3. **Document Management**: Association between documents and transactions/declarations

---

## Actionable Steps

### 1. Database Schema - Document Archive & Compliance Alerts

**Create Migration:** `migrations/030_add_document_archive_compliance_alerts.sql`

#### Create `document_archive` table:
- `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
- `user_id` (INTEGER, foreign key to users)
- `document_type` (cfdi, contract, receipt, invoice, bank_statement, tax_declaration, other)
- `file_name` (TEXT)

- `is_active` (BOOLEAN, default 1)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

#### Create indexes:
- `idx_document_archive_user_type` on `document_archive(user_id, document_type)`
- `idx_document_archive_related` on `document_archive(related_entity_type, related_entity_id)`
- `idx_document_archive_fiscal_period` on `document_archive(fiscal_year, fiscal_month)`
- `idx_compliance_alerts_user` on `compliance_alerts(user_id, is_read, is_resolved)`

- `v_active_alerts` - Active (unresolved) alerts by user
- `v_upcoming_deadlines` - Upcoming fiscal calendar events
- `v_document_statistics` - Document counts and sizes by user

#### Create triggers:
- Update timestamp triggers for all tables
- Alert creation trigger when compliance issues detected

### 2. Cloudflare R2 Configuration

#### Update `wrangler.toml`:
Add R2 bucket binding for document storage:
```toml
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "DOCUMENTS"
bucket_name = "avanta-finance-documents"
preview_bucket_name = "avanta-finance-documents-preview"
```

#### Create R2 Utilities:
**Create file:** `src/utils/r2Storage.js`
- `uploadDocument(file, metadata)` - Upload document to R2
- `downloadDocument(fileKey)` - Download document from R2
- `deleteDocument(fileKey)` - Delete document from R2
- `generateSignedUrl(fileKey, expiresIn)` - Generate temporary access URL
- `listDocuments(prefix)` - List documents in folder

---

---

### 5. Integration & Business Logic

#### Document-Transaction Association:
- When uploading CFDI, auto-link to transaction by UUID
- Allow manual association of documents to transactions
- Show associated documents in transaction details view
- Bulk association tools for multiple documents

#### Document-Declaration Association:
- Link supporting documents to declarations
- Show documents used for declaration in declaration details
- Require documents for certain declaration types

#### Alert Generation Automation:
- Daily cron job (Cloudflare Worker cron trigger) to check:
  - Upcoming payment deadlines (7 days, 3 days, 1 day, due date)
  - Missing CFDIs on recent transactions
  - Unreconciled transactions older than 30 days
  - Unsigned bank statements older than 30 days
  - Uncategorized transactions
- Real-time alerts on user actions:
  - Cash payment exceeds limit on transaction creation
  - IVA threshold exceeded
  - ISR threshold exceeded

#### Compliance Score Integration:
- Update Phase 22 Fiscal Analytics compliance score to include:
  - Document completeness (transactions with supporting docs)
  - Alert resolution rate
  - Proactive compliance (resolved before due date)

## Technical Considerations

### Cloudflare R2 Best Practices:
- Use consistent key naming conventions (e.g., `users/{userId}/documents/{year}/{month}/{filename}`)
- Implement multipart uploads for large files
- Set appropriate cache headers for downloads
- Use signed URLs with reasonable expiration times (1 hour default)
- Implement proper error handling for R2 operations
- Consider storage quotas per user

### File Upload Security:
- Validate MIME types on both frontend and backend
- Scan for malicious content (if tooling available)
- Limit file sizes (10MB default, configurable)
- Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal
- Generate unique keys to prevent collisions
- Store checksums for integrity verification

### Alert System Design:
- Implement rate limiting for alert generation
- Avoid duplicate alerts (check existing alerts before creating)
- Use batch processing for alert generation
- Implement alert expiration (auto-resolve after deadline passes)
- Allow users to configure alert preferences
- Send email notifications for critical alerts (optional)

### Performance Optimization:
- Use pagination for document listings
- Implement lazy loading for document thumbnails
- Cache fiscal calendar events
- Optimize database queries with proper indexes
- Use connection pooling for R2 operations

### Mexican Fiscal Compliance:
- **Cash Payment Limit**: Alert when transaction exceeds $5,000 MXN in cash
- **CFDI Requirement**: Alert for expenses >$2,000 without CFDI
- **Payment Deadlines**: ISR/IVA payment by 17th of following month
- **DIOT Deadline**: Last day of following month
- **Annual Declaration**: April 30th for individuals
- **Document Retention**: Keep documents for 5 years (SAT requirement)

---

## Database Considerations

### Storage Considerations:
- Estimate storage needs: Average 10MB per document √ó 100 documents per user = 1GB per user
- Implement storage quotas per user tier
- Monitor R2 costs and optimize as needed
- Implement document archival strategy (move old docs to cheaper storage)

### Data Integrity:
- Foreign key constraints for related entities
- Cascading deletes where appropriate
- Transaction support for complex operations
- Regular backups of metadata database
- Separate R2 backups if needed

### Indexing Strategy:
- Index frequently queried fields (user_id, document_type, fiscal_year)
- Composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Avoid over-indexing to maintain write performance

---

## Integration Points

### Phase 18 (CFDI Manager):
- Auto-upload CFDI XML files to document archive
- Link uploaded CFDIs to transactions
- Show associated documents in CFDI manager

### Phase 19 (Tax Calculations):

- Implement role-based access (admin, user)
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure API endpoints with authentication

### Data Privacy:
- Encrypt sensitive document metadata
- Use secure HTTPS for all file transfers
- Implement data retention policies
- GDPR/privacy compliance considerations
