# Implementation Roadmap - Guide for Future Development

This document provides a structured approach for planning and implementing future phases (V9, V10, V11+) of the Avanta Finance project. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and organization across all implementation cycles.

## Current Status

- **Last Completed Phase:** Phase 39 (Accessibility and Performance Audit)
- **Last Implementation Plan:** V8 (Phases 30-39)
- **Next Implementation Plan:** V9 (starts with Phase 40)
- **Ready for:** New feature development, advanced capabilities, and optimizations

## Implementation Plan Versioning System

### Version Naming Convention
- **Format:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V{number}.md`
- **Current:** V8
- **Next:** V9, V10, V11, etc.
- **Location:** Create in root, archive after completion to `docs/archive/implementation-plans/v{number}/`

### Phase Numbering System
- **Format:** `PHASE_{number}_{description}.md`
- **Current Range:** Phases 5-39 (completed)
- **Next Range:** Phases 40+ 
- **Numbering:** Sequential, never reuse numbers
- **Location:** Create in root during development, archive after completion to `docs/archive/phases/phases-{start}-{end}/`

## Creating a New Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Define the Plan Scope

Before creating IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V9.md, determine:

1. **Objective:** What is the main goal of this implementation plan?
2. **Phase Count:** How many phases will it include? (typically 8-12 phases)
3. **Phase Range:** What phase numbers will it cover? (e.g., 40-50)
4. **Focus Areas:** What features/improvements will be addressed?
5. **Timeline:** Estimated completion time for all phases
6. **Dependencies:** What must be complete before starting?

### Step 2: Structure the Implementation Plan

Use this template structure for each new implementation plan:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan v{N}: {Title}

**Objective:** [Clear statement of the plan's main goal]

**Context:** [Background information, what was completed previously, why this plan is needed]

**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS / ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Phase {X}: {Phase Name}

**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS / ‚úÖ COMPLETE / ‚è≥ PENDING  
**Objective:** [What this phase aims to accomplish]

**Technical Plan:**

1. **{Task Category 1}:**
   - ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Task 1 description
   - ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Task 2 description
   - ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Task 3 description

2. **{Task Category 2}:**
   - ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Task 1 description
   - ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Task 2 description

**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ/‚è≥ File or feature 1
- ‚úÖ/‚è≥ File or feature 2
- ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Documentation updates

**Verification Status:**
- ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Build succeeds
- ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Tests pass
- ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Feature works as expected
- ‚úÖ/‚è≥ Documentation updated

---

[Repeat for each phase]
```

### Step 3: Create Phase Documentation

For each phase, create the following documents:

1. **`PHASE_{X}_PROMPT.md`** (if applicable)
   - Initial requirements
   - User stories
   - Acceptance criteria

2. **`PHASE_{X}_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`**
   - Technical specifications
   - API endpoints
   - Database changes
   - UI/UX modifications
   - Code examples

3. **`PHASE_{X}_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`**
   - What was accomplished
   - Files modified/created
   - Known issues
   - Future considerations

4. **`PHASE_{X}_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md`** (if UI changes)
   - Screenshots
   - UI flow diagrams
   - Component descriptions
   - Design decisions

5. **Additional phase-specific docs** as needed
   - Testing guides
   - Migration scripts
   - Configuration changes
   - Security considerations

### Step 4: Track Progress

Update the implementation plan document as phases complete:

- Change status from ‚è≥ PENDING ‚Üí üîÑ IN PROGRESS ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Mark tasks with ‚úÖ as they finish
- Update verification status
- Add notes about issues or changes
- Update completion dates

## Archiving Process

### When to Archive

Archive documentation after:
- All phases in an implementation plan are complete
- The next implementation plan has been started
- Code is deployed to production
- Documentation is finalized

### How to Archive

1. **Move Implementation Plan:**
   ```bash
   mv IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V{N}.md docs/archive/implementation-plans/v{N}/
   ```

2. **Move Phase Documents:**
   ```bash
   # Create directory for phase range
   mkdir -p docs/archive/phases/phases-{start}-{end}/
   
   # Move all phase files
   mv PHASE_{X}_*.md docs/archive/phases/phases-{start}-{end}/
   ```

3. **Update PHASES_INDEX.md:**
   - Add new implementation plan section
   - List all completed phases
   - Update quick reference numbers
   - Add changelog entry

4. **Commit and document:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/archive/
   git commit -m "Archive: Implementation Plan V{N} - Phases {start}-{end}"
   ```

## Getting Help

### Resources
- **PHASES_INDEX.md** - See what's been completed
- **TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Technical details
- **docs/DEVELOPMENT.md** - Setup and development workflow
- **GEMINI.md** - AI assistant context
- **docs/archive/** - Historical implementation details

### Common Questions

**Q: What phase number should I use next?**  
A: Check PHASES_INDEX.md for the last completed phase, then use the next sequential number.

**Q: How many phases should be in an implementation plan?**  
A: Typically 8-12 phases that can be completed in a reasonable timeframe (1-3 months).

**Q: Can I modify a completed phase?**  
A: No, phases are immutable once completed. Create a new phase for additional work or fixes.

**Q: Should I archive incomplete phases?**  
A: No, only archive phases and plans that are 100% complete and verified.

**Q: What if I find a bug in a completed phase?**  
A: Create a new phase or a bug fix document to address it, referencing the original phase.

## Maintenance Schedule

### Monthly

- Update progress on in-progress phases
- Archive completed plans and phases
- Update PHASES_INDEX.md

### Quarterly
- Review overall project status
- Plan next implementation plan
